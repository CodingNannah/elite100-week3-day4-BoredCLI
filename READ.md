# Bored to Enthused Activity

This project utilizes CLI programming skills I have learned over the past week to create an application that utilizes the Bored API from  http://www.boredapi.com/.

The player will choose a virtual amount to spend, and the program returns a random daily activity to alleviate boredom.

### To download and run the application:
- open the terminal in the directory you would like to save this project

- clone this repository in that directory

    ```
#    git clone https://github.com/CrtlAltElite/Poke_CLI
    ```

- Navigate into the folder you just created with the clone:

    ```
#    cd Poke_CLI 
    ```

- after this completes enter to create a virtual environment on Windows/Linux:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

- or on Mac:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```


- Activate your venv on WINDOWS enter:

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On Mac or Linux activate your venv with:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

- Install the requirements by entering:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Now the environment is configured and you can run the application on Windows/Linux:

    ```
    python .
    ```

- or on Mac

    ```
    python3 .
    ```
 Enjoy!
